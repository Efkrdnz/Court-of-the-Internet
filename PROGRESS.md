# Build Progress Checklist

Requirements: [`GOAL.md`](GOAL.md) · Design: [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md)

Legend: `[x]` done and verified · `[~]` in progress · `[ ]` not started

## Phase 1: Product architecture & gameplay specification
- [x] Inspect environment (Node 22, Postgres 16 local, Playwright 1.63 + Chromium preinstalled, no Docker daemon)
- [x] Choose stack (Next 16 / React 19 / Prisma 6 / Postgres / Tailwind 4 / Zod 4 / Motion / Vitest / Playwright)
- [x] Lifecycle state machine, quorum rules, progression, moderation, monetization design (`docs/SPEC.md`)

## Phase 2: Database design & backend foundations
- [x] Prisma schema (16 models) + init migration
- [x] Prisma singleton, env config, `CourtError`, injectable game clock
- [x] DB-backed atomic rate limiter (tested under concurrency)
- [x] Content filter (PII, links, handles, slurs with leetspeak, threats, serious crime, spam) + Zod schemas
- [x] Seed script that plays 42 cases through the real services under a simulated clock

## Phase 3: Authentication, authorization & case lifecycle
- [x] scrypt password hashing, HMAC-hashed DB sessions, httpOnly cookie, sliding expiry
- [x] Sign up / log in / log out / demo login; password change rotates other sessions
- [x] Services: confess, atomic claim, release, file defense/rebuttal, vote, idempotent close
- [x] Claim expiry + requeue (lazy + sweep, grace period), extension, dismissal, mistrial
- [x] Integration tests: lifecycle, role restrictions, double votes (incl. concurrent), 12-way claim race, stats audit

## Phase 4: Gameplay interfaces
- [x] Confession page (category tiles, live preview, counters, anonymity, honeypot)
- [x] Attorney queue + editor (filters, sorting, random assignment, countdown, draft autosave, release)
- [x] Prosecutor queue + editor (defense excerpts, full defense in editor)
- [x] Jury duty (pinned case, vote booth with confirm step, tally reveal, next case)
- [x] Courtroom dashboard (pending actions, docket counts, active cases, daily quests, recommendations)

## Phase 5: Visual identity, illustrations, animations
- [x] Design tokens, 4 self-hosted typefaces, parchment/velvet/plaque/folder surfaces, film grain
- [x] Original SVG characters: owl judge (3 moods), pigeon attorney, raccoon prosecutor, hamster, bulldog bailiff, cat jury (4 moods), crying pizza
- [x] Stamps, wax seals, gavel, evidence folder, crest, 12 category icons, 30 UI icons, ornaments
- [x] 20 achievement badges (4 tiers + locked), avatar builder (8 species × 8 hats × 6 accessories × 6 backdrops), 5 empty-state scenes
- [x] Microinteractions (gavel slam, stamp slam, verdict reveal, vote transitions, confetti, hover reactions); reduced-motion respected (OS + per-user setting, hydration-safe)

## Phase 6: Statistics, profiles, achievements, leaderboards
- [x] XP/levels/titles, reputation (verdict-only, floored), streaks; recompute audit matches counters
- [x] Achievement engine (20 achievements) + unlock toasts with badge art
- [x] Profiles with themes (6, level/achievement/premium locked), featured badge, role records, history
- [x] Leaderboards with Wilson ranking + participation thresholds (6 boards + entertaining cases)

## Phase 7: Archives, discovery, sharing
- [x] Archives: search, category/verdict filters, recent/popular/controversial/funniest, verdict statistics, pagination
- [x] Case detail: caption, timeline, all three arguments, participants, tallies, verdict reveal, related cases
- [x] Open Graph images / downloadable share card, copy link, copy verdict summary, native share, Reddit/X
- [x] Reactions (Hilarious/Outrageous/Legendary/Relatable), featured case of the day, community highlights, landing stats

## Phase 8: Moderation, security, edge cases
- [x] Rules page; reports (case/defense/prosecution), auto review at 3 distinct reporters
- [x] Moderation console: queue, seal/restore, strike arguments, ban/unban, adjourn, feature, roles, grant cosmetics, stats audit, audit log
- [x] Settings: profile/avatar/theme, reduced motion, muted categories, featuring opt-out, password, account deletion
- [x] Security headers + CSP, rate limits on every mutation, anonymity (no ids in DTOs), safe redirects, cron secret
- [x] Monetization architecture (`PaymentProvider`, entitlements, fairness test)

## Phase 9: Integration testing, accessibility, responsive polish
- [x] Playwright e2e: full trial across 5 browser contexts, guards, reactions, reports
- [x] axe accessibility checks on 13 pages (no serious/critical violations)
- [x] Mobile (Pixel 7) checks for 13 pages + mobile nav
- [x] Bugs found & fixed by e2e: Zod 4 optional checkbox keys, React 19 form reset wiping inputs, grid overflow on mobile, streaming redirects

## Phase 10: Final debugging, docs, deployment prep
- [x] `tsc`, ESLint, `next build` clean
- [x] README (setup, scripts, testing, deployment, external services, limitations), MONETIZATION.md
- [x] Final verification against GOAL.md §12: app starts, full lifecycle e2e, role restrictions, single votes, atomic claims, stats audit, profiles/leaderboards, persisted archives, navigation, validation, art + animations, mobile, clean tsc/lint/build, automated tests, README, documented limitations
